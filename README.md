## üöÄ Setup

### ### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   An internet connection to download the model on the first run.

    ```txt
    streamlit
    transformers
    torch
    ```
    *Note: Depending on your system (e.g., if you have an NVIDIA GPU and want CUDA support), you might need a specific version of PyTorch. For most standard use cases, the command below will suffice.*

2.  Open a terminal and install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
